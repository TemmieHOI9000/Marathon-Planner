# Training Planner for marathons.

For this webapp, I think there will likely be 2+ pages:

### First page: 
Current calendar with overlays for training and training times (monthly, weekly, maybe daily). Similar to Google Calendar. It sees all the notes for each training time.

### Second page: This page creates a training plan. 
- First, it sets the time frame of the current date to when the Race will start and the distance of the race. 
- Second, you set your pace based on the chart provided by the Nike NRC.
- Third, you build the training plan by taking the different training blocks and arranging them on a weekly schedule to see what workout is done on a particular day*
- Fourth(?), there should be some sort of "algorithm" that I guess "auto-generates" the training plan underneath the custom weekly schedule that labels all the workouts that will be done.

### Third page: could be a log-in page in order to connect with Google Calendar API or something.

**More ideas could be possible, but they must be thought out beforehand. The deadline for this project will be approximately 20 weeks before the marathon starts.**


**For simplicity's sake, each week will be consistent with training, and there will only be 4 types of days: long runs (1), recovery runs (2), speed training (1), and rest days (2)*
